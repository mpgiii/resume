		\opening{To whom it may concern:}
		
		I am excited to submit my application for your [JOB TITLE] position. As a Computer Engineering student who will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in June 2021, I can be a valuable asset to the team.
		
		While working as a embedded software engineering intern at Aruba Networks in 2019 and 2020, I was thrown straight into the mix, and contributed directly to the codebase of their networking products. I had the unique opportunity of actually having many refactors and APIs that I wrote directly merge, and I also worked on modifying and maintaining test cases, debugging when necessary. I was fortunate to have been given this experience, as I'm sure all of the skills I've gained from this will be helpful to [COMPANY NAME].
		
		In school, I also focused on many projects, including filesystem readers, weather stations, RISC-V based microprocessors, and research. Cal Poly's "Learn By Doing" approach has given me the unique experience of having a great deal of hands-on experience with programming and project management. These strengths could be a great asset for [COMPANY NAME].
		
		These internships and projects have allowed me to apply the knowledge I have in programming. At Aruba as well as throughout my education, I was able to demonstrate my ability to meet deadlines, work with a team, follow style guidelines, and thoroughly test code. I'm confident these skills will be put to good use at [COMPANY NAME].
		
		Thank you for your time and consideration.
		
		I look forward to your reply, and talking with you further about the position.
		
		\closing{Yours truly,}
