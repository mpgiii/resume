        \opening{To whom it may concern:}

        I am excited to submit my application for your Software Engineer 
        position. As a pet owner (and, perhaps more importantly, a software 
        engineer) with experience in both embedded systems and full-stack web 
        development, I can be a valuable asset to the company.

        I have been at Amazon for three years, and my time there has provided me
        the skills needed to be an efficient and productive software engineer. 
        While there, I have designed and built many software solutions while 
        collaborating with project managers to identify key requirements. I 
        have experience building and maintaining quality software -- I have built
        many full CI/CD pipelines, implemented full unit testing and feature 
        testing, learned new programming languages on the fly (such as Java), 
        designed and implemented REST APIs, determined monitoring and alarm 
        thresholds, and participated both as a contributor and a Scrum master 
        in a Scrum development environment.
        
        I am proud to have made important contributions on my team beyond just
        coding, such as writing feature design documents and owning multiple 
        critical product features. These features have been deployed to production
        on Amazon.com. I believe these skills would apply perfectly to the work
        done at Vetsource, especially given the job description.

        As someone who is a proud cat owner and is passionate about delivering
        useful products for veterinarians, I believe I would make a perfect fit
        on an engineering team at Vetsource.

        Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your reply, 
        and talking with you further about the position.

        \closing{Yours truly,}

    \end{letter}
